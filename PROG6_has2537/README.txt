The game of GoFish has 2 players.

THE RULES ARE SIMPLE: each players goal is to form pairs of identically ranked cards.
To do so, when its a players turn, the player can ask the next player in rotation if they have cards of a certain rank.
If they do, the player takes that card from them, if not, the player draws a card from the deck.
As soon as a player has a pair, they book it and place the cards face up on the table.
The game ends when all books are formed or the deck runs out of cards for players to draw.
The player with the MOST BOOKS at the end wins. Best of Luck!

The results are copied to to the file gofish_results.txt.
